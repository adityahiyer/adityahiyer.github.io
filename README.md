Hello! I'm Aditya H Iyer.

I'm a fourth-year student at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. While I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering, I'm also pursuing a minor in Physics. 

I would like to commit to research and academia as a professional career. I hope I'll be getting started on a PhD soon after I graduate. I'm interested in STEM in general, and that means everything from Astronomy to Biophysics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to Pharmacology.

On this website you can find my CV, a few pre-prints I've co-authored, and some projects I've worked on. Have fun!

Currently based in Chennai, India.
