Hello! I'm Aditya H Iyer.

I'm a fourth-year student at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. I'm working towards a major in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Physics. 

I would like to commit to research and academia as a professional career. I hope to be getting started on a PhD soon after I graduate. I'm interested in STEM in general, and that means everything from Astronomy to Biophysics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to Pharmacology.

On this website you can view or download my [CV](https://adityahiyer.github.io/Resume_1.pdf), a few pre-prints I've co-authored, and some projects I've worked on. Thanks for visiting!

Currently based in Chennai, India.
