Hello! I'm Aditya H Iyer.

I'm an R&D intern at Lincoln Electric. I graduated from BITS Pilani in July 2025 with a B.E., majoring in Chemical Engineering and minoring in Physics.  

I'm interested in all kinds of research in general, but particularly in chemical and nuclear science and engineering. In my free time I play around with open-source programs and applications in these areas â€” something I've been doing since my undergraduate days. It follows that my research experience is mostly computational.

Outside of scientific and academic pursuits, I like quizzing and trivia. I'm also keeping myself busy learning Kannada and French.

On this website you can view or download my [CV](https://adityahiyer.github.io/Resume_1.pdf), a few pre-prints I've co-authored, and some projects I've worked on. I also like to write about cricket and metros. Thanks for visiting!

Currently based in Chennai, India.
