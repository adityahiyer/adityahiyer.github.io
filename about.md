Hello! I’m Aditya H Iyer.

I’m an R&D intern at Lincoln Electric. I graduated from BITS Pilani in July 2025 with a B.E., majoring in Chemical Engineering and minoring in Physics.

I’m interested in all kinds of research in general, but particularly in chemical and nuclear science and engineering. In my free time I play around with open-source programs and applications in these areas — something I’ve been doing since my undergraduate days. It follows that my research experience is mostly computational.

Outside of scientific and academic pursuits, I like quizzing and trivia. I’m also keeping myself busy learning Kannada and French.

I'm planning to get back to school and earn my master's and doctoral degrees. If you're a PI looking for a student who's fairly average at a _lot_ of things, and also _really_ good at a few specific things, I could be a great fit in your laboratory. Feel free to [contact me](https://adityahiyer.github.io/contact), and I'd be happy to discuss research themes and potential projects. I'm curious about a lot of things, so I'm sure I can find a shared interest to get behind. I'm intending to get started on my graduate studies in 2027.

On this website you can find my CV, links to papers I’ve co-authored, and some projects I’ve worked on. I also like to write about [cricket](https://adityahiyer.github.io/cricket) and [metros](https://adityahiyer.github.io/metros), and I think you'll enjoy reading about them. Thanks for visiting!

Currently based in Chennai, India.
